## ☣️ Overview

Project-T is a sophisticated GRUB theme inspired by the aesthetics of the Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus research facility. This theme transforms your boot menu into a sleek, futuristic interface reminiscent of Umbrella's high-tech facilities.
> ⚡ **Note**: This is an initial strain of the virus. Further mutations and enhancements are in development in our laboratories.

## 🧪 Laboratory Notes

This variant was derived from [CyberGRUB-2077](https://github.com/adnksharp/CyberGRUB-2077.git), modified with Umbrella's aesthetic protocols.
